## Rock Paper Scissors - Game with VanillaJs

A rock paper scissiors game created with pure vanilla javascript. The game is pretty advanced. It includes cool animations, modal popups, data storage in form of score and much more. All the modern ES6+ features are used to create the app. The design and functionality is all done by me from scratch.
